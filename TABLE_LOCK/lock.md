In MySQL, the `LOCK TABLES` statement is used to explicitly lock tables, restricting access to them for other database sessions until the lock is released. This can be useful in certain situations when you need to ensure exclusive access to a table or to prevent other sessions from modifying data while your session performs a series of operations. Here are some common use cases for the `LOCK TABLES` statement:

1. **Backup Operations**: When you need to create a backup of a table, you can use `LOCK TABLES` to ensure that no other sessions can write to the table while the backup is being created. This ensures data consistency in the backup.

2. **Bulk Data Load**: When you are loading a large amount of data into a table using `INSERT` or `LOAD DATA INFILE`, you may want to lock the table to prevent other sessions from accessing it until the data load is complete.

3. **Data Migration**: During a data migration, you may need to lock tables to ensure that the data remains consistent and doesn't change during the migration process.

4. **Exporting Data**: When exporting data from a table, you can lock the table to prevent any changes to the data while the export is in progress.

Here's an example of how to use `LOCK TABLES` and `UNLOCK TABLES`:

```sql
-- Lock a table for reading
LOCK TABLES table_name READ;

-- Lock a table for writing
LOCK TABLES table_name WRITE;

-- Perform operations on the locked table

-- Release the lock
UNLOCK TABLES;
```

Keep in mind that when you use `LOCK TABLES`, it only affects the current session. Other database sessions can still read from the locked table, but they cannot write to it. This can cause potential contention if not used carefully, as other sessions will be blocked from writing to the table until the lock is released.

It's important to use `LOCK TABLES` with caution, as it can lead to performance issues or deadlocks if not used properly. In many cases, you can achieve the same results using other techniques, such as transactions and isolation levels, which are often a better choice for managing data consistency and concurrency in MySQL.
